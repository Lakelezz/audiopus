# About

`audiopus` is a high-level binding of [`Opus`] version 1.3.

Orginally, this crate was made to empower the [`serenity`]-crate to build audio features on Windows, Linux, and Mac.

Everyone is welcome to contribute,
check out the [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) for further guidance.

# Building

## Requirements

### UNIX/GNU/MSYS2
You will need `gcc`, `libclang`, `make`, `automake`, `autoconf`, and
`libtool`.
Note that `automake` uses `autoconf` as dependency already.
If you have `pkg-config`, the underlying [`audiopus_sys`]-crate will try finding
Opus with `pkg-config`.

### MSVC
Currently, `audiopus` links to a prebuilt Opus hence should just work.
It supports x86 and x64 as dynamic or static build.

## How Audiopus links
`audiopus` uses [`audiopus_sys`], it links to Opus 1.3 and supports Windows,
Linux, and MacOS.
By default, it statically links to Windows, MacOS, and if you use the
`musl`-environment. It will link dynamically for Linux except when using
mentioned `musl`.

Environment variables named `LIBOPUS_STATIC` or `OPUS_STATIC` will take
precedence over features thus overriding the behaviour. The value of these
environment variables have no influence on the result: If one of them is set,
statically linking will be picked.

## Pre-installed Opus
If you have Opus pre-installed, you can set `LIBOPUS_LIB_DIR` or
`OPUS_LIB_DIR` to point to the directory in which your Opus lies.
Be aware that using an Opus other than version 1.3 may not work.
